the script can automatically assign enrichments to the various avram
collections. Uses scheme of harvest_type (3 letter code), campus slug, repo
slug, collection id for the filename.

the filename can be split on _ and components matched. Would be good to create
a Django app to handle this but want to work with Adrian, Brian, Amy et. al. for
that.

function should look for descending file names, first fully spec'd and then 
down to a minimum of harvest_type
